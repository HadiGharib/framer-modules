# Publishing Your Module
###### *Please note this is a guide for publishing before the project is released (release planned on Monday)*

## 1. Create an example code (snippet)
People who will use your module need to know how it works. For these purposes,
*create a code snippet* that shows how to use your module and save it
in a `.coffee` file.

Please don't include `require()` statement in your example.

## 2. Create `module.json`
Module.json holds all important metadata about your module.

| key            | type              | description                           |
| ---------------|:-----------------:|---------------------------------------|
| `name`         | *String*          | Human readable name of your module that is seen in the app. <br /><br />Do know that a `unique_name` **will be automatically created** from the `name` and used as the main identificator for the directory name, dependency link, etc.
| `description`  | *String*          | Brief description of what your module does *(recommendedÂ 100Â characters).*
| `author`       | *String*          | Your name, right?
| `require`      | *String*          | A `require()` statement that will load your module to the prototype.<br /><br />*Please avoid using path to the module file that includes `.framer`. Framer won't be able to recognize the module.*
| `install`      | *String or Array* | Path to the file(s) you'd like to be downloaded and installed to the prototype. Please note it's only possible to define exact files, not full directories.
| `example`      | *String*          | Path to the file with the snippet created in step 1.
| `thumb` *(optional)*        | *String*          | Path to the thumbnail. Thumbnails are shown at `80Ã—80px` (@2x is recommended). <br />Please use a thumbnail with opaque background (`#1D1D1F` is recommended). Allowed filetypes are `mp4` `mov` `png` `jpg` `gif`.
| `dependencies` *(optional)* | *Array*           | Array of dependencies' *unique names*. Please note each dependency will be installed inside a subdirectory named after their `unique_name`.

### Example `module.json`
Taken from [this module](https://github.com/kysely/framer-bidirectional-cycle).
```javascript
{
    "name": "Bidirectional Cycle",
    "description": "Extension that will make Utils.cycle() iterate in both directions",
    "author": "Radek Kysely",

    "require": "Utilscycle = require 'Utilscycle'",
    "install": "Utilscycle.coffee",
    "example": "example.coffee",

    "thumb": "bidirectional-cycle-thumb.mov"
}
```

### Note
To maintain clean prototype directories hierarchy, modules will be installed to
a subdirectory in `modules` folder named after their `unique_name`. If you need
to reach parent directories from your code, please use one more set of `../`.

Please note the `require()` command *will be automatically updated* to reach
module's actual directory.

*Example: A module named `iOS Status Bar` will get a unique name `ios-status-bar`
and will be installed to `<PATH_TO_PROTOTYPE>/modules/ios-status-bar/`.
All paths inside your repository will be preserved under the modules's directory.*

## 3. Push to GitHub
And keep it there. Your module will always be installed from its GitHub repository.

### Add the badge to your README
*If you want to* that show your module can be discovered and installed
via Framer Modules, you can include the following badge to your `README.md`.
Clicking the badge will also automatically open the app and redirect the
user to your module!

<a href='#' onclick='alert("This is just an example ðŸ™‚")'>
    <img alt='Install with Framer Modules'
    src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kysely/framermodules.com/master/assets/badge@2x.png' width='160' height='40' /></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Just copy one of the snippets and replace `<MODULE NAME>` with yours as defined in `name` key.

:warning: **Please note that you won't be able to see the badge in your README until Monday. This is expected behavior since the domain's DNS are still in configuration. You can leave the code in your docs and badge will start working once the app is released.**

HTML **(recommended)**
```html
<a href='https://open.framermodules.com/<MODULE NAME>'>
    <img alt='Install with Framer Modules'
    src='https://www.framermodules.com/assets/badge@2x.png' width='160' height='40' /></a>
```

Markdown (will use @1x version)
```md
[![Install with Framer Modules](https://www.framermodules.com/assets/badge.png)](https://open.framermodules.com/<MODULE NAME>)
```

## 4. ~~Publish to Framer Modules~~ [Send me the link](https://m.me/kysely)
~~Open Framer Modules, click Publish button in the top right corner,
enter your GitHub repository link and follow the instructions on the screen.~~

**Until the project is public, please just send the link to me, I'll fresh-publish all the modules upon the app release :)**

## Okay, how do I update? (once the app is released)
Just push the changes to GitHub. If you make some changes to `module.json`,
you will just re-publish in Framer Modules as described in step #4.
